## Why Eye Dominance Matters

### For Sports and Activities
Eye dominance significantly impacts performance in:
- **Shooting Sports**: Rifle, pistol, archery, and hunting
- **Ball Sports**: Baseball batting, tennis, golf putting
- **Combat Sports**: Boxing stance and defensive positioning
- **Photography**: Which eye you naturally use with a viewfinder

### For Vision and Health
Understanding your eye dominance helps with:
- **Vision Correction**: Ensuring dominant eye gets optimal prescription
- **Post-Surgery Recovery**: Monitoring changes after eye procedures
- **Age-Related Changes**: Tracking how dominance may shift over time
- **Visual Training**: Optimizing exercises for your visual system

### Beyond Simple "Left" or "Right"
Most people think eye dominance is binary, but it's actually a spectrum:
- **Strong Dominance**: Clear preference for one eye (most common)
- **Weak Dominance**: Slight preference, but can switch easily
- **Mixed Dominance**: Dominance varies by task or distance
- **Central Vision**: Rare condition where both eyes contribute equally

## Understanding Your Results

### The Dominance Scale
Your results are displayed on a scale from -1 to +1:

- **-1.0 to -0.5**: Strong left eye dominance
- **-0.5 to -0.25**: Moderate left eye dominance  
- **-0.25 to +0.25**: Central/mixed dominance
- **+0.25 to +0.5**: Moderate right eye dominance
- **+0.5 to +1.0**: Strong right eye dominance

### Visual Representation
The app shows your dominance on an interactive axis:
- **Blue zone (left)**: Left eye dominance
- **Gray zone (center)**: Mixed/central dominance  
- **Red zone (right)**: Right eye dominance
- **Dot position**: Your precise measurement

*[Screenshot placeholder: Dominance axis visualization]*

### Consensus Score
The app provides three measurements:
- **Right Hand Result**: Dominance based on right-hand pointing
- **Left Hand Result**: Dominance based on left-hand pointing
- **Consensus**: Average of both hands (most reliable)

The consensus score is generally the most accurate representation of your true eye dominance.

## Interpreting Measurements

### What the Numbers Mean

**Strong Dominance (0.5 to 1.0)**
- Clear, consistent eye preference
- Optimal for activities requiring precision aiming
- Less likely to change with fatigue or stress
- Most people fall into this category

**Moderate Dominance (0.25 to 0.5)**
- Noticeable but not overwhelming eye preference
- May be able to train non-dominant eye effectively
- Could experience some switching under certain conditions

**Mixed/Central Dominance (-0.25 to +0.25)**
- No strong eye preference
- Rare condition affecting 5-10% of population
- May experience advantages in some sports
- Could benefit from vision training

### Consistency Analysis
Pay attention to how similar your right-hand and left-hand results are:
- **Very similar results**: High confidence in your dominance pattern
- **Different results**: May indicate mixed dominance or measurement variability
- **Opposite results**: Very rare, may suggest retesting

## Tips for Best Results

### Photography Best Practices
- **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting - avoid shadows on the face
- **Distance**: 3-6 feet is optimal - too close distorts proportions
- **Stability**: Hold phone steady - use both hands if needed
- **Timing**: Take photo when pointer is steady, not moving

### Pointing Technique
- **Natural stance**: Stand comfortably, don't strain
- **Straight arm**: Extend arm naturally, don't over-reach
- **Steady finger**: Point directly at camera lens, keep finger still
- **Eye focus**: Look directly at the camera lens. Not your finger. Not the operator. Look continuously at the camera lens.

### Marking Accuracy
- **Zoom in**: Use pinch gestures for precise marking
- **Pupil center**: Mark the exact center of each pupil
- **Fingertip**: Mark the very tip of the pointing finger
- **Take your time**: Accuracy is more important than speed

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
- **Don't look at the phone screen** while pointing
- **Don't change distance** between right and left hand tests  
- **Don't rush** the marking process
- **Don't test when tired** - fatigue can affect results

## Scientific Background

### The Finger-Pointing Method
This app uses a finger-pointing technique for eye dominance assessment, which:
- Is based on the principle that your dominant eye aligns better with pointed objects
- Provides quantitative measurements rather than simple binary results
- Offers a practical, equipment-free method for assessment
- Can be performed consistently with proper technique

### How the Calculation Works
The app uses geometric analysis to:
1. **Measure alignment**: Calculate how each eye aligns with your pointing finger
2. **Compare perspectives**: Determine which eye's view best matches your pointing direction  
3. **Quantify dominance**: Convert alignment differences into a precise dominance score
4. **Normalize results**: Account for individual anatomical variations

### Limitations and Considerations
- **Lighting dependent**: Poor lighting can affect measurement accuracy
- **Distance sensitive**: Extreme close-up or far-away photos may skew results
- **Marking dependent**: Accuracy of results depends on precise point marking
- **Not diagnostic**: This app is for informational purposes only, not medical diagnosis
- **Not clinically validated**: This specific implementation has not undergone formal scientific validation

### About Eye Dominance Testing
Eye dominance (ocular dominance) is a well-established concept in vision science. Common tests include:
- **Porta test**: Looking through a small aperture
- **Miles test**: Viewing through hands formed in a triangle
- **Pointing tests**: Various finger or object pointing methods
- **Sighting tests**: Alignment tasks with distant objects

This app implements a digital version of pointing-based assessment, providing quantitative results rather than the typical binary (left/right) outcome. While the concept of eye dominance and pointing tests are established, this specific digital implementation and scoring algorithm are unique to this app and have not been independently validated through peer-reviewed research.
