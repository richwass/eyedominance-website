# Common Ways of Measuring Eye Dominance

Eye dominance refers to the preference of visual input from one eye over the other, especially in tasks requiring precise alignment. Knowing which eye is dominant is useful for shooting sports, archery, golf, and other activities where alignment and accuracy matter.  

Below are the **three most common and widely used approaches** to measuring eye dominance, plus a modern digital option.

## 1. The Miles Test (Triangle Test)
- **Method:** Extend both arms forward and create a small triangular opening between the hands (e.g., by overlapping thumbs and fingers). With both eyes open, focus on a distant object through the opening.  
- **Result:** When each eye is closed in turn, the dominant eye is the one that keeps the object centered within the triangle.  
- **Advantages:** Simple, no tools required, reliable for most people.  
- **Limitations:** Can sometimes be affected by hand preference or lack of focus.

## 2. The Porta Test (Pointing Test)
- **Method:** Extend one arm and point at a distant object with the index finger, keeping both eyes open. Close one eye, then the other.  
- **Result:** The dominant eye is the one where the finger appears to stay aligned with the object. With the non-dominant eye, the finger seems to “jump” off target.  
- **Advantages:** Quick, intuitive, commonly taught in sports and vision training.  
- **Limitations:** Slightly less precise for people with weak or mixed dominance.

## 3. The Hole-in-the-Card Test (Card Test)
- **Method:** Hold a card or piece of paper with a small hole at arm’s length. Focus on a distant object through the hole with both eyes open. Then alternately close each eye.  
- **Result:** The eye that continues to see the object through the hole is the dominant eye.  
- **Advantages:** Easy to administer, frequently used in optometry clinics.  
- **Limitations:** Requires a card/prop; less convenient in the field.

## A Modern Option: The EyeDominanceApp
While traditional tests are fast and simple, **digital tools now make the process even easier and more accurate**. The [**EyeDominanceApp**](https://eyedominanceapp.com) guides users step by step through validated tests using their phone’s camera. It records results, provides visual confirmation, and helps track subtle dominance shifts over time.  

This makes it simpler than ever for athletes, coaches, and clinicians to measure eye dominance reliably without special equipment.
