## Stance and Setup Fundamentals

### Box Positioning

**Distance from Plate by Dominance:**

*Cross-Dominant Hitters:*
- Stand 2-4 inches closer to plate
- Allows better plate coverage
- Compensates for delayed recognition
- Reduces swing path length

*Same-Side Dominant:*
- Standard distance (6-8 inches from plate)
- Can stand slightly farther for power
- Better pitch recognition allows coverage

*No Clear Dominance:*
- Middle distance approach
- Adjust based on pitcher tendencies
- Daily feel-based positioning

**Front/Back Foot Placement:**

*Closed Stance (front foot closer to plate):*
- Benefits cross-dominant hitters
- Improves inside pitch coverage
- Reduces head movement needed
- Better for pull hitters

*Open Stance (front foot away from plate):*
- Benefits same-side dominant
- Improved pitch recognition
- Better opposite field coverage
- Enhanced plate coverage

*Square Stance:*
- Neutral option for all dominance types
- Good starting point for youth
- Allows natural adjustments

**Height Adjustments in Box:**

*Front of Box:*
- Extra time for cross-dominant hitters
- Better for fast-pitch recognition
- Allows earlier swing decisions

*Back of Box:*
- Benefits same-side dominant hitters
- More time for breaking balls
- Better pitch plane alignment

*Middle:*

### Coach Testimonials

**High School Coach - 15 Years Experience:**
*"Understanding eye dominance changed how I teach hitting. We now assess every player's dominance pattern and adjust accordingly. Our team batting average improved 25 points in the first season, and strikeouts decreased significantly. The key is working with each player's natural abilities rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach."*

**Travel Ball Coach - 8 Years Experience:**
*"I've seen dramatic improvements in players once we identify cross-dominance issues. One player went from hitting .180 to .320 in one season simply by adjusting his stance and working on pitch recognition drills specific to his dominance pattern. Parents are amazed at the difference proper assessment makes."*

**College Assistant Coach:**
*"We now screen all incoming recruits for eye dominance. It's part of our standard evaluation process. Players who understand their dominance pattern adapt faster to college-level pitching. We've developed specific training protocols for each dominance type, and our offensive production has increased measurably."*

**Professional Hitting Instructor:**
*"Eye dominance is the missing piece in many players' development. I've worked with major leaguers who never realized they were fighting their natural vision. Small adjustments based on dominance patterns can add 20-30 points to a batting average. It's not just about mechanics - it's about working with your body's natural design."*
