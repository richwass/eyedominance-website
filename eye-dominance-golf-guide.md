## Quick Reference for Golfers

### Assessment Table

| Dominance Type | Primary Impact | Quick Fixes | Equipment Solutions |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Right Eye Dominant** | Tends to aim left of target | Move ball position slightly forward; strengthen grip | Alignment sticks; offset putter |
| **Left Eye Dominant** | Tends to aim right of target | Move ball position slightly back; weaken grip | Draw-biased driver; heel-weighted putter |
| **Cross-Dominant** (Right-handed, Left Eye) | Inconsistent alignment; over-the-top swing | Focus on shoulder alignment; use intermediate target | Strong offset putter; alignment training aids |

### Common Symptoms by Golf Skill

**Beginner Golfers:**
- Consistent directional misses (always left or right)
- Difficulty judging distances on approach shots
- Struggle with putting alignment
- Inconsistent ball striking

**Intermediate Golfers:**
- Plateau in scoring improvement
- Inconsistent putting performance
- Occasional "mystery" bad shots
- Difficulty with course management

**Advanced Golfers:**
- Minor but persistent directional tendencies
- Pressure putting struggles
- Inconsistency in windy conditions
- Fine-tuning challenges

## Putting Performance

### Ball Position and Setup

**Right Eye Dominant Golfers:**
- Position ball 1-2 inches forward of center stance
- Keep head positioned so right eye is directly over ball
- Slightly open stance (left foot pulled back 1-2 inches)
- Eye line should track 6-12 inches inside target line

**Left Eye Dominant Golfers:**
- Position ball at center or slightly back of center stance
- Head positioned with left eye over ball or slightly inside
- Square to slightly closed stance
- Eye line parallel to target line or slightly outside

**Cross-Dominant Golfers:**
- Ball position varies by individual - test both forward and back
- Focus on keeping both eyes level at address
- May benefit from slightly wider stance for stability
- Use intermediate target 12-18 inches ahead of ball

### Reading Greens

**Break Perception by Dominance:**

*Right Eye Dominant:*
- Naturally sees more break than actually exists
- Should reduce break read by 10-20%
- Focus on entry speed rather than line
- Use feet to feel slope when walking green

*Left Eye Dominant:*
- May underread break, especially left-to-right putts
- Add 10-15% more break to initial read
- Walk behind hole to confirm break direction
- Use plumb-bob method for verification

*Cross-Dominant:*
- Most challenged with green reading
- Get multiple perspectives (behind ball, behind hole, low side)
- Use chalk line or string for practice rounds
- Focus on speed control over line

### Plumb-Bobbing Technique Modifications

**Standard Technique (Right Eye Dominant):**
1. Stand 6-8 feet behind ball
2. Hold putter vertically at arm's length
3. Close left eye, use right eye to sight
4. Align putter shaft with ball
5. Observe how hole relates to shaft

**Left Eye Dominant Modification:**
1. Stand slightly closer (5-6 feet behind ball)
2. Close right eye, use left eye
3. May need to adjust distance for clear sight picture
4. Cross-reference with walking the line

**Cross-Dominant Alternative:**
1. Use both eyes open
2. Focus on overall slope feeling rather than precise line
3. Combine with AimPoint or other systematic approaches
4. Practice with known breaks to calibrate perception

### Green-Reading Training Drills

**The Quarters Drill:**
- Set up 4-foot putts from north, south, east, west of hole
- Practice reading subtle breaks from each position
- Goal: Make 7 out of 10 from each position
- Focus on how dominance affects each direction

**Speed Ladder Drill:**
- Place tees at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 feet from hole
- Putt to lag each distance to 18-inch circle
- Measures distance control affected by dominance
- Practice 3 times per week for improvement

**Break Calibration Drill:**
- Find 6-foot putt with 2-4 inches of break
- Make 20 putts, noting where you aimed vs. where ball went
- Adjust aim point based on results
- Repeat weekly to maintain calibration

### Putter Selection and Fitting

**Offset Putters:**
- **High Offset (3/8" - 1/2"):** Cross-dominant golfers
- **Medium Offset (1/4" - 3/8"):** Left eye dominant
- **Low/No Offset:** Right eye dominant
- **Recommended Models:**
  - Odyssey White Hot OG #7 (Medium offset) - $179
  - TaylorMade Spider GT (High offset) - $399
  - Scotty Cameron Phantom X (Variable offset) - $429

**Alignment Aid Effectiveness:**

*Right Eye Dominant:*
- Simple single sight line works best
- Avoid complex multi-line systems
- Contrasting colors (white on black) most effective
- Examples: Ping Vault 2.0 Piper C ($159)

*Left Eye Dominant:*
- Multiple alignment lines can be helpful
- Geometric shapes (triangles, arrows) work well
- Examples: TaylorMade Spider Tour ($349)

*Cross-Dominant:*
- High-contrast, simple alignment features
- Avoid busy visual patterns
- Examples: Odyssey Stroke Lab Seven S ($399)

**Length Fitting Modifications:**
- **Standard Length (35"):** Most right eye dominant golfers
- **Shorter (33-34"):** Left eye dominant, promotes better posture
- **Longer (36-37"):** Cross-dominant, helps maintain distance from ball
- **Measurement Method:** Eyes over ball position determines optimal length

### Putting Stroke Mechanics

**Arc vs. Straight-Back-Straight-Through:**

*Right Eye Dominant:*
- Natural slight arc stroke works well
- 10-15 degree arc typical
- Focus on consistent tempo
- Keep head still until ball leaves putter face

*Left Eye Dominant:*
- May benefit from straighter stroke
- Use shoulder-driven motion
- Minimize hand/wrist action
- Practice with alignment sticks for path

*Cross-Dominant:*
- Experiment with both methods
- Consistency more important than style
- May need more practice time to groove
- Consider putting lessons for technique refinement

**Head Movement Patterns:**
- **Right Eye Dominant:** Keep head still, allow natural eye tracking
- **Left Eye Dominant:** Slight head rotation toward target acceptable
- **Cross-Dominant:** Minimize all head movement until follow-through

**Distance Control Techniques:**

*The Metronome Method:*
- Use consistent 2:1 or 3:1 back-to-forward tempo
- Right eye dominant: Focus on acceleration through impact
- Left eye dominant: Focus on length of backswing
- Cross-dominant: Focus on consistent rhythm

*Clock System:*
- 6 o'clock = shortest backstroke
- 7 o'clock = medium backstroke  
- 8 o'clock = longest backstroke
- Practice each position for consistent distances

- Reduced doubt during setup
- Improved course management

*Feel Improvements:*
- More natural setup positions
- Better balance and posture
- Increased clubface awareness
- Improved tempo and rhythm

**Progress Milestones:**

- Sustained improvement maintained
- Ready for advanced techniques

**Troubleshooting Plateaus:**

*Common Plateau Causes:*
- Inconsistent practice
- Reverting to old habits under pressure
- Equipment not optimized
- Need for professional help

*Plateau Solutions:*
- Video analysis to identify regression
