## Shotgun Sports (Trap, Skeet, Sporting Clays)

### Understanding the Challenge

Cross-dominance creates the most significant challenges in shotgun sports due to several factors:

**Why Cross-Dominance Matters More:**
- **Moving targets**: Unlike stationary rifle targets, clay birds move at high speeds
- **Lead calculation**: Your brain calculates lead based on the dominant eye's perspective
- **Time pressure**: Split-second decisions leave no time to compensate mentally
- **Binocular vision**: Both eyes open shooting is critical for tracking moving targets

**The Moving Target Problem:**
When your dominant eye is opposite your shooting shoulder, your brain receives conflicting information about target location and speed. This creates:
- Inconsistent lead pictures
- Late shot timing
- Difficulty with crossing targets
- Reduced break percentage on long targets

**Lead Calculation Issues:**
- Cross-dominant shooters often shoot behind targets
- Lead appears different than it actually is
- Compensation becomes inconsistent under pressure
- Results in "poke and hope" shooting instead of confident leads

### Solutions by Severity

#### 1. Mild Cross-Dominance

**Squinting/Closing Non-Dominant Eye:**
- Close non-dominant eye 50% (heavy squint)
- Maintains some binocular vision for target acquisition
- Practice: 50 targets per session with squint until automatic
- Warning: Can cause eye fatigue during long shooting sessions

**Scotch Tape on Shooting Glasses:**
- Place frosted tape on dominant eye lens over pupil area
- Allows peripheral vision while blocking central vision
- Use 1/2" circle of tape, adjust size as needed
- Gradually reduce tape size as adaptation occurs

**Head Position Adjustments:**
- Rotate head 10-15 degrees toward shooting side
- Lower cheek deeper into stock
- May require stock length adjustment (shorter)
- Practice mount 100x daily for muscle memory

#### 2. Strong Cross-Dominance

**Learning to Shoot from Dominant-Eye Side:**
- Extended relearning process required
- Start with dry mounting at home (consult instructor for proper technique)
- Begin with close, slow targets
- Expect significant initial performance reduction
- **Professional instruction strongly recommended for this transition**

**Stock Modifications:**

*Cast Adjustments:*
- Minor cast modifications may help align sights with dominant eye
- **Professional fitting required** - improper modifications can create safety hazards
- Consult certified gunsmith for proper measurements and implementation
- Consider trying before permanent modifications

*Crossover Stocks:*
- Specialized stocks designed for cross-dominant shooters
- Allows shooting from strong shoulder with dominant eye
- **Professional consultation essential** for proper selection and fitting
- Research available options through certified dealers

**Red Dot Sight Solutions:**
- May eliminate traditional sight alignment challenges
- Can facilitate both eyes open shooting
- **Professional installation recommended** for proper mounting and zeroing
- Research compatibility with your specific firearm and shooting discipline
- Check competition rules before installation

### Specific Techniques

#### Modified Gun Mount for Cross-Dominant Shooters

**The "Cant" Mount:**
1. Rotate gun 15-20 degrees toward dominant eye side
2. Bring head more upright
3. Dominant eye looks over the barrel instead of behind it
4. Practice sequence:
   - Week 1: 25 dry mounts daily
   - Week 2: 50 dry mounts + 25 live targets
   - Week 3: 100 dry mounts + 50 live targets
   - Week 4: 100 dry mounts + 100 live targets

#### Pre-Shot Routine Adjustments

**Standard Routine Modification:**
1. Call for target
2. Sight with shooting eye (forcing dominance)
3. Track target for 2-3 feet before shooting
4. Shoot when lead picture looks correct

**Cross-Dominance Specific:**
1. Close dominant eye during gun mount
2. Open dominant eye just as target appears
3. Force shooting eye to acquire target first
4. Ignore dominant eye input during lead calculation

#### Station-Specific Strategies for Trap/Skeet

**Trap Shooting:**
- Station 1: Aim 12" above trap house, normal lead
- Station 2: Aim 6" above, expect straight-away
- Station 3: Close dominant eye during mount
- Station 4: Heavy squint on dominant eye
- Station 5: May need to cant gun 20 degrees

**Skeet Shooting:**
- High House 1: Start gun at window, track with shooting eye
- High House 7: Most difficult - consider switching shoulders
- Low House 2: Close dominant eye until bird clears center
- Doubles: Pick easier bird first, commit fully

## Rifle Shooting

### Scope Shooting

#### Scope Mounting Position Adjustments

**Forward Scope Position:**
- Mount scope 1-2" farther forward than normal
- Increases eye relief from 3.5" to 4.5"
- Allows more head movement for comfortable sight picture
- Use medium or high rings to clear objective lens

**Angled Scope Bases:**
- 0-MOA base for most applications
- 20-MOA base for long range (helps with cross-dominance at distance)
- Consider adjustable bases: $150-300

#### Eye Relief Considerations

**Optimal Eye Relief Setup:**
- Cross-dominant shooters need 4-5" eye relief minimum
- Test with different cheek positions before finalizing
